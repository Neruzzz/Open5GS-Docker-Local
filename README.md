# Open5GS
# Things to do on the docker compose
TODO Build services
TODO Assign static ips to each service
TODO Send the yaml configurations
TODO Execute the command that starts the desired service inputing the -c with the desired yaml from the volume
TODO bash script with the ogstun configuration for the user communication

# Todo UERANSIM
TODO create the UERANSIM image
TODO Figure out how to set up or commuicate with all the other services and the command/yaml on the compose for configuration


# Things to do general
TODO Maybe try to build webui inside of the open5gs image?
TODO Maybe build the mongodb service on the base image so it is on all other images
TODO Simple example running different services from the docker compose on the same machine (using privete ips)
TODO Simple example running different services but in different machines (using public ips)
